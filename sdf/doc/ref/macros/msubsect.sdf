H1: subsections Macro

H2: Interface

!macro_interface "subsections"

H2: Description

The {{subsections}} macro specifies the subsections in a topic.

H2: Examples

Typical usage is:

E:   H1: MyApp
E:   !subsections "Purpose,Usage,Description,Examples"

In this case, the {{MAC:subsections}} macro changes the
{{id}} generated for the headings listed to:

E:   MyApp - {{heading}}

For HTML, it will also generate a line of jumps to the headings.

H2: Limitations & Future Directions

{{html}} is currently the only target for which a jump line is generated.
