H1: Understanding Filter Interfaces

H2: Overview

H3: General Syntax

The general syntax for using each filter is shown first.
By convention, the filter is shown using the {{MAC:block}}
and {{MAC:endblock}} macros, although filters can also be
used with other macros, including {{MAC:include}} and {{MAC:execute}}.

H3: Parameters

If a filter has one or more optional parameters, these are listed
in a table containing the following columns:

* {{Name}} - the parameter name
* {{Type}} - the parameter type
* {{Rule}} - the pattern, if any, used to validate the value.

H3: Parameter Types and Rules

Parameter types and rules follow the same conventions
as macro argument types and rules. Refer to
{{SECT:Understanding Macro Interfaces}} for details.

H2: Data Tables

H3: Table Fields

Providing data to a filter via a table is a common idiom in SDF as
using tables makes it easy to add additional columns later on.

If a filter expects a table of data in {{FMT:TBL}} format,
the fields in the table of data are listed
in a table containing the following columns:

* {{Field}} - the field name
* {{Category}} - {{key}}, {{mandatory}} or {{optional}}
* {{Rule}} - the pattern, if any, used to validate the value.

H3: Table Field Categories

The supported table field categories are explained below.

!block table
Category        Description
key             a unique value must be provided for each row
mandatory       a value must be provided for each row
optional        a value is optional
!endblock

H3: Validating Table Fields

As validating table fields can reduce performance quite a bit,
the {{CMD:sdf}} program doesn't validate them by default. To enable
table field validation, use the -v option like this:

V:  sdf -v99 ...

Typically, this is only needed when a filter isn't working as you'd
expect.
