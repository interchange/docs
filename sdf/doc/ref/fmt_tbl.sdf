H1: TBL Format

H2: Purpose

{{TBL}} format is a text-based format for storing tabular data.

H2: Overview

The basic rules are:

* blank lines and comment lines are ignored,
* the first data line specifies the record format,
* each remaining data line specifies a single record.

Comment lines begin with # as the first non-whitespace character.

H2: Record Formats

For a given table, all records have the same format.
The record format is either:

* {{delimited}} - fields are separated by a special character, or
* {{fixed-width}} - fields are defined by column positions.

An example of delimited format is given below.

!block example
# A simple TBL example
Name:Age:Phone:Addr
Bill:42:397 1234:14 Smith St, New Farm
Sarah:37:892 4321:105 Brown St, Chelmer
Joe:44:365 7890:6 Royal Av, Buranda
!endblock

An example of fixed-width format is given below.

!block example
# A simple TBL example
Name    Age     Phone           Addr
Bill    42      397 1234        14 Smith St, New Farm
Sarah   37      892 4321        105 Brown St, Chelmer
Joe     44      365 7890        6 Royal Av, Buranda
!endblock

Note: Tabs in fixed-width records are assumed to be 8 spaces wide.

H2: Input Format Specification

The first data line is called the {{input format specification}}.
It specifies:

* the name and order of the fields in each record
* the record format - delimited or fixed-width

Field names can contain:

* alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)
* the underscore character (_)

If the first character after the first field name is a space or tab,
the format is assumed to be {{fixed width}}. Otherwise, the format is
{{delimited}} with fields separated by the special character found.

H2: Multi-line Fields

Generally, each data line specifies a single record.
However, if the last field begins with the sequence '<<',
then it is a multi-line field terminated by the first line
beginning with '>>'. Multi-line fields are supported by both
record formats.

Within a multi-line field, blank lines and lines starting
with # are treated as part of that field. i.e. it is not
possible to embed a comment line within a multi-line field.

An example of a table containing multi-line fields is given below.

!block example
# A simple TBL example with multi-line fields
Name    Age     Phone           Addr
Bill    42      397 1234        <<
14 Smith St
New Farm QLD 4005
>>
Sarah   37      892 4321        <<
105 Brown St
Chelmer QLD 4068
>>
Joe     44      365 7890        <<
6 Royal Av
Buranda QLD 4102
>>
!endblock

H2: Special Characters in Fields

For delimited fields:

^ If a field contains the delimiter character or the double quote character,
  it must be enclosed in double quotes.
+ A double quote character within a field is represented by two double quotes.
+ Leading whitespace is kept.
+ Trailing whitespace is kept.

For fixed-width fields:

^ Leading whitespace is kept.
+ Trailing whitespace is removed.

Note: Multi-line fields are enclosed by the << and >> symbols so none
of the rules above apply to them.
