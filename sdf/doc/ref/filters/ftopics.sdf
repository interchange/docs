H1: topics Filter

H2: Interface

!filter_interface "topics"

H2: Description

The {{topics}} filter is used to include a set of sub-topics
into a document. For [[PostScript]], this implies that the heading levels
on topics included as sub-topics are adjusted accordingly.
For [[HTML]] and Windows help files, this implies that hypertext jumps
are inserted to the topics.

This filter expects a table of data in {{FMT:TBL}} format.
The only field typically provided is {{Topic}} - the name of the file
containing the topic, excluding the {{.sdf}} extension. The other
fields are used by SDF internally during the generation of HTML
topics.

The {{intro}} parameter can be used to specify SDF text to be
output before the hypertext jumps. This text is not output for
formats where the topics are simply included, e.g. PostScript.

The {{noslide}} parameter stops the heading levels of the topics
being slid down.

The {{data}} parameter is used to specify that the table is topics
data and no output should be generated. This parameter is used
by SDF internally during the generation of HTML topics.
