H1: example Filter

H2: Interface

!filter_interface "example"

H2: Description

The {{example}} filter is used to specify a section of fixed-width text.
Unlike the {{FILT:verbatim}} filter, embedded SDF symbols (like E<2{>)
are relevant.

The {{skipheader}} parameter is useful when an external file is being
included as an example, but you do not want the header comment in
the example. The {{lang}} parameter, if any, is used to determine
the commenting conventions. If no language is specified, comments
are assumed to start with a # and be terminated by the end of line.

The {{lang}} parameter can be used to pretty-print programming languages.
In practice, this means:

* comments are output in italics
* keywords are output in bold.

Note: The {{FILT:langdefs}} filter is used to configure the information
the pretty-printing feature needs to know. A large number of languages
are predefined in the {{FILE:stdlib/langdefs.sdm}} file.

The {{wide}} parameter can be used to ensure that at least 80 characters
are output on a line before it is wrapped.

The {{listitem}} parameter can be used to specify that this block
of text is part of a list. The value is the logical
indent of the list (e.g. 1, 2, etc.).

The {{pure}} parameter can be used to escape special SDF symbols
(like E<2{>) embedded within the text.

H2: Examples

!block example; lang='sdf'

# Include myfile.c but exclude the copyright, revision history, etc.
!include "myfile.c"; example; skipheader; lang='c'

# Pretty-print the same file
!include "myfile.c"; example; wide; lang='c'
!endblock
