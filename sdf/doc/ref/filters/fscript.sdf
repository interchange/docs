H1: script Filter

H2: Interface

!filter_interface "script"

H2: Description

The {{script}} filter can be used to embed arbitrary Perl source
code within an SDF document. This is useful for many things including:

* declaring Perl subroutines implementing SDF filters and macros
* accessing databases
* updating log files.

H2: Examples

!block example; lang='sdf'
!block script
printf STDERR "Hello world!\n";
!endblock
!endblock

H2: Limitations & Future Directions

As arbitrary sections of [[Perl]] can be included and executed,
the code can potentially cause harm. At the moment, the ability
to update external files from within an SDF document is seen as
a {{feature}}. However, a version of SDF which restricts the
embedded Perl to "safe" operations would be nice.
