H1: about Filter

H2: Interface

!filter_interface "about"

H2: Description

The {{about}} filter is used when including a topic as
an "about" section within a document. Typically, this implies:

* the headings are converted to plain headings and slid down one level
* the headings (except those initially at level 1) are removed from
  the table of contents.

H2: Examples

A typical book might look like this:

!block example; lang='sdf'
!init OPT_STYLE="manual"

!define DOC_NAME "A Sample Book"
!build_title

!include "myabout.sdf"; about
!include "chapter1.sdf"
!include "chapter2.sdf"
!include "chapter3.sdf"
!include "appendx1.sdf"; appendix
!endblock
