H1: Book Mode

By default, {{CMD:sdf}} processes each argument as a single document.
i.e. a single stream of paragraphs is passed to the {{format driver}}
for conversion. This mode is good enough for most documents.

In {{book mode}}, {{CMD:sdf}} processes each argument as a "book".
i.e. a set of {{MAC:include}} macros specifying the chapters.
In this mode, a shell script is generated which treats each chapter
as a "pseudo-document". This mode is required when:

^ you wish to generate a [[FrameMaker]] book

+ you want to generate a list of figures, list of tables or index

+ each chapter has a fancy cover page.

Book mode can be activated via {{CMD:sdf}}'s -b option.

Note: The {{VAR:OPT_BOOK}} variable can be used to check if book mode is
active. However, it cannot be used to enable or disable the mode.
