H1: Custom Formatting

H2: Overview

One of the nice things about [[SDF]] is that system administrators
can control the formatting of documents via templates.
This has two major advantages:

^ document authors can focus on content
+ by default, documents have a consistent format.

However, there are occasions when authors need to override the
default formatting conventions. Custom formatting is supported
for documents, paragraphs and phrases.

H2: Custom Document Formatting

Document formatting can be controlled by setting variables.
The commonly used ones are given below.

!block table
Name                Type        Purpose
DOC_TOC             integer     table of contents level
DOC_LOF             boolean     build a list of figures
DOC_LOT             boolean     build a list of tables
DOC_IX              boolean     build an index
DOC_TWO_SIDES       boolean     build a two-sided document
!endblock

For example, to create a two-sided document,
add this line to your document:

E:  !define DOC_TWO_SIDES

H2: Custom Paragraph Formatting

Paragraph formatting can be controlled by setting attributes.
The commonly used ones are given below.

!block table
Name            Purpose
label           prefix label (e.g. Note:)
top             either Page (the default), Column, LPage or RPage
left            left margin indent (in points)
first           first line indent (in points)
right           right margin indent (in points)
justify         either Full, Left, Right or Center
!endblock

For example, to start a paragraph at the top of a page:

E: H3[top] Other Issues

To indent a paragraph 1 inch from both margins:

E: [left='1in'; right='1in'] This paragraph will be indented from
E: both margins by 1 inch.

The result is:

[left='1in'; right='1in'] This paragraph will be indented from
both margins by 1 inch.

H2: Custom Phrase Formatting

Phrase formatting can be controlled by setting attributes.
The commonly used ones are given below.

!block table
Name            Purpose
family          font family
size            font size
color           text colour
bold            enable bold
italics         enable italics
underline       enable underline
changed         enable change bars
!endblock

For example, to change the size of a phrase to 11.5 points:

V:  I love {{N[size=11.5]custom formatting}}.

The result is:

I love {{N[size=11.5]custom formatting}}.


H2: Applying Phrase Attributes to Paragraphs

Phrase attributes can also be used for paragraphs.
For example, to add a change bar to a paragraph:

E:  [changed] This paragraph has a change bar.

The result is:

[changed] This paragraph has a change bar.


H2: sdf Blocks

Attributes can be applied to a block of text by using the {{FILT:sdf}}
filter. For example:

!block example; pure
!block sdf; size='8pt'; bold; align='Center'
This paragraph has custom formatting:

* and so does this.
!endblock
!endblock

The result is:

!block sdf; size='8pt'; bold; align='Center'
This paragraph has custom formatting:

* and so does this.
!endblock

!end_topic
