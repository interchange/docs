H1: A simple example

H2: A sample SDF document

A sample SDF document is shown below:

!include "../paper/mydoc.sdf"; verbatim

Note: This document (called {{FILE:mydoc.sdf}}) is provided in
the {{FILE: doc/paper}} directory of the SDF distribution.

H2: A brief explanation

Comments begin with a # character as the first non-whitespace
character on a line.

Macros are embedded commands which begin with a ! as the
first non-whitespace character on a line.
The {{MAC:define}} macro is used to set variables.
The value of a variable can be embedded in paragraph
text  by using the E<2[>...E<2]> syntax.

The DOC_NAME and DOC_TYPE variables are used by
the {{MAC:build_title}} macro which creates:

* a cover page (or two) for paper-based outputs
* a title header for online outputs.

Paragraphs can be tagged in different ways. For the vast majority of
SDF documents, the only tags used are:

!block table
Tag     Meaning
H1:     level 1 heading
H2:     level 2 heading
*       item in level 1 bulleted list
-       item in level 2 bulleted list
^       first item in level 1 ordered list
+       next item in level 1 ordered list
>       fixed-width, verbatim text
Note:   note
!endblock

Phrases can also be tagged in several ways. Any phrase can be tagged
using the syntax:

>  {{XYZ:...}}

where XYZ is the tag. For single, uppercase character tags like
I (Italics) and B (Bold), POD-style syntax is also supported:

>  X<...>

where X is the tag.

Tables can be specified using the {{FILT:table}} filter, typically
in combination with the {{MAC:block}} and {{MAC:endblock}} macros.
The first row is the headings. Remaining rows are data.
