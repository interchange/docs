H1: Paragraphs

H2: Introduction

Paragraphs have the following format:

E:   line1
E:   ...
E:   lineN

Leading and trailing whitespace on lines is generally ignored.
Paragraphs are separated by blank lines or:

* {{comment lines}} - first non-whitespace character is "#"
* {{macros}} - first non-whitespace character is "!".

For normal paragraphs, simply specify the text on one or more lines.
For example:

E:   I like products which are simple to use and
E:   do what I expect. We should encourage engineers
E:   to design more products with these qualities.


H2: Paragraph styles

A paragraph can be given a style using the following syntax:

E:   style":"line1
E:   ...
E:   lineN

Tagged paragraphs do not need to be separated by blank lines.
{{style}} is a sequence of one or more of the following characters:

* letters
* digits
* underscore character (_).

Whitespace is not permitted before the ":" but is generally
ignored immediately after it. The style is optional and
defaults to N (for Normal). The text is also optional.


H2: Commonly used styles

Commonly used paragraph styles are given below.

!block table
Style           Description
N               normal paragraph (the default)
H1 .. H6        chapter heading at level 1-6
A1 .. A6        appendix heading at level 1-6
P1 .. P6        plain heading at level 1-6
Note            a single paragraph note
E               fixed-width (example) text
!endblock

For example:

E:   Note: Life is too short to drink bad wine.

The result is:

Note: Life is too short to drink bad wine.


H2: Special styles

For certain styles, the following syntax is also supported:

E:   special_style line1
E:   ...
E:   lineN

The special styles available are:

!block table
Style           Description
. .. ......     paragraph or plain list item at level 1-6
* .. ******     unordered list at level 1-6
- .. -----      unordered list at level 2-6
^ .. ^^^^^^     first entry in an ordered list at level 1-6
+ .. ++++++     next entry in an ordered list at level 1-6
!endblock

For example:

E:* fruits:
E:  - peach
E:  - banana
E:* vegetables:
E:  - potato
E:  - carrots.

The result is:

* fruits:
  - peach
  - banana
* vegetables:
  - potato
  - carrots.
