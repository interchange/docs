H1: Overview

H2: Features

SDF supports a range of features related to figures:

* figures can be imported in a variety of formats including:
  - EPS - Encapsulated PostScript
  - WMF - Windows MetaFile
  - MIF - Maker Interchange Format
  - GIF - Graphics Interchange Format
  - JPEG - JPEG File Interchange Format
  - PNG - Portable Network Graphic Format
  - BMP - Windows Bitmap Format

* logos can be easily added to title pages and online headers
* figure positioning can be controlled
* text can be wrapped around figures.

H2: Importing Figures Into SDF Documents

The {{MAC:import}} macro is usually used to import a figure.
The syntax is:

E:  !import "filename" {{1:[; parameters]}}

For example:

E:  !import "sdfarch"

H2: Importing a Figure Into Paragraph Text

To import a figure into the middle of a paragraph,
the IMPORT phrase style is used.
The syntax is:

!block example; pure
    {{IMPORT:filename}}, or
    {{IMPORT[parameters]filename}}
!endblock

For example:

!block example; pure
Please visit our {{IMPORT:new}} web site!
!endblock

H2: Figure Extensions

It is generally best {{not}} to specify an extension for the filename
containing the figure, as SDF will then use the best format it can find.
The search rules are:

!block table
When_generating     The_search_order_is
PostScript          epsi, eps, wmf, mif, gif
HTML                jpeg, jpg, png, gif
Windows Help        bmp
!endblock

So a GIF file is all that is necessary if you are generating
PostScript and HTML. However, if SDF finds an EPS file when it
is generating PostScript, it will use that instead.

H2: Adding Logos

The default implementations of the {{MAC:build_title}} macro,
{{FILT:title}} filter and HTML header macros provide an easy
way to add a company logo: by defining variables.
The variables are:

!block table
Variable            Description
DOC_LOGO            the default logo
DOC_TITLE_LOGO      used in the title of a PostScript document
DOC_ADMIN_LOGO      used in the title of a PostScript admin. document
DOC_HTML_LOGO       used in the title of a HTML document
DOC_TOPIC_LOGO      used in the header of a HTML topic
DOC_MANUAL_LOGO     used on the front cover of a PostScript manual
DOC_COMPONENT_LOGO  used on the cover of each chapter in a PostScript manual
!endblock

In each case, the value of the variable is the filename
containing the figure.

If a given logo variable is not set, DOC_LOGO is used if it is set.
Therefore, a company logo can be added to most SDF documents by
simply defining DOC_LOGO is a configuration module (or library)
which is loaded into every SDF document via the {{MAC:use}} (or
{{MAC:inherit}}) macro.
