H1: Sizing Columns

H2: Dynamic Sizing

SDF supports dynamic column widths for paper documentation, i.e.
if a width is not specified for a column, then the column is
sized based on the text within it and the space available.
As a result, it is rarely necessary to explicitly size columns.

H2: The format Attribute

The {{format}} attribute of the {{FILT:table}} filter is used
to specify column widths for paper documentation. Its value
is either:

* a single number, in which case each digit represents 10% of the
  width available to the table, or

* a comma-separated list of column width specifications.

For example, to specify 3 columns with widths of 20%, 10% and
30% respectively:

E:!block table; format=213
E:Name   Age Address
E:Bill   42  123 Main Road
E:Joe    21  456 Queen Street
E:!endblock

The result is:

!block table; format=213
Name    Age Address
Bill    42  123 Main Road
Joe     21  456 Queen Street
!endblock

Note: The {{format}} parameter has no impact on HTML
generation - all columns in HTML are currently dynamically sized.

H2: Column Width Specifications

Examples of the column width specifications supported are given below.

!block table
Value       Meaning
30pt        an exact size (other supported units are cm, mm, " and in)
30%         a percentage of the size available
30          a percentage of the size available (% is implicit)
10-20       dynamic size between 10% and 20% of the total width
-20         dynamic size between 0% and 20% of the total width
10-         dynamic size between 10% and 100% of the total width
-           dynamic size between 0% and 100% of the total width
3*          3 units of the remaining space
*           same as 1*
!endblock

For example, in the table below, the second column will be
twice the size of the last column.

!block example
!block  table; format="20,2*,10,*"
Name    Column2             Column3     Column4
A       B                   C           D
X       Hello dear world    Y           Z
!endblock
!endblock

The output is:

!block  table; format="20,2*,10,*"
Name    Column2             Column3     Column4
A       B                   C           D
X       Hello dear world    Y           Z
!endblock

H2: Default Sizing Rules and Narrow Tables

If a column is not given a size, the following rules are used:

^ The last unspecified column size is implicitly '*' (i.e. the rest),
  unless the {{narrow}} attribute is set, in which case the size
  is implicitly '-' (i.e. as much as needed).

+ The other unknown sizes are implicitly '-'.

For example, the first and third columns in the table below
will be dynamically sized. The first column will take as
much space as required and the last column will expand so
that the table takes the full width of the text area.

!block example
!block  table; format=",30,,10"
Name    Column2             Column3     Column4
A       B                   C           D
X       Hello dear world    Y           Z
!endblock
!endblock

The output is:

!block  table; format=",30,,10"
Name    Column2             Column3     Column4
A       B                   C           D
X       Hello dear world    Y           Z
!endblock

However, in the example below, each column will only take
as much space is required, making the table narrower
than it would be otherwise.

!block example
!block  table; narrow
Name    Column2             Column3     Column4
A       B                   C           D
X       Hello dear world    Y           Z
!endblock
!endblock

The output is:

!block  table; narrow
Name    Column2             Column3     Column4
A       B                   C           D
X       Hello dear world    Y           Z
!endblock

H2: Equalised Column Widths

If an = character is used in place of a - character for a column
width, then those columns will be equalised in size.
For example, the second and forth columns in the table
below will be made equal in size.

!block example
!block  table; format="20,5=30,10,="
Name    Column2             Column3     Column4
A       B                   C           D
X       Hello dear world    Y           Z
!endblock
!endblock

The output is:

!block  table; format="20,5=30,10,="
Name    Column2             Column3     Column4
A       B                   C           D
X       Hello dear world    Y           Z
!endblock
