H1: Headings

H2: Chapter Headings

Headings are specified using the tags H1 .. H6:

* H1 is a chapter heading
* H2 .. H6 are sub headings

The actual presentation of H-style headings (e.g. numbered or unnumbered)
is decided by the target format and document style.

H2: Other Headings

The following heading tags are also supported:

* A1 .. A6 - headings in {{Appendices}}
* P1 .. P6 - headings in {{plain}} sections (e.g. Glossary)

P-style headings are always unnumbered so are commonly used in memos.

In normal documents, it is often unnecessary to use A-style or
P-style tags. The preferred approach is to:

* store each section in a file using H-style headings
* convert the heading style using the {{FILT:appendix}} or {{FILT:plain}}
  filter as the file is being imported.

For example:

E:  !include "budget.sdf"; appendix

Using this approach, sections can easily be reused in different ways
in different documents.

H2: Generating a Table of Contents

A table of contents can be generated from the heading paragraphs.
All types of heading tags (i.e. H, A and P) are included.
The depth of the table of contents is specified by the {{VAR:DOC_TOC}} variable.
For example, to generate a table of contents including headings
up to and including level 4:

E:   doccvt -o -DDOC_TOC=4 mydoc.sdf

Note: For normal documents, the {{MAC:build_title}}
macro defaults this variable to 3.

Individual headings can be excluded from the table of contents
by specifying the {{PATTR:notoc}} attribute. For example:

E:   H3[notoc] Yet Another Heading

See {{SECT:Attributes}} for further details on attribute syntax.

H2: Controlling Page Breaks

Generally speaking, page breaks are controlled by rules associated
with heading tags. For example:

* for documents, memos and faxes, each level 1 heading starts a new page
* for manuals, each level 1 heading starts a new chapter and
  each level 2 heading typically starts a new page.

The {{PATTR:top}} paragraph attribute can be used to position
a paragraph at the top of the next page. For example:

E:  H3[top] Abc Module

Page breaks can also be explicitly specified using the PB tag.
For example:

E:  text on one page.
E:  PB:
E:  H3: Another Section

Note:
[[SDF]] is designed to be a {{logical markup language}}.
While it is sometimes necessary to explicitly specify page breaks
in order to get the layout you want, doing so can reduce the portability
of your document to different styles, page sizes and target formats.
