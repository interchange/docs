H1: Looks

H2: Changing the look

The overall appearance of a paper-based output format can be controlled
by initialising the OPT_LOOK variable on the top line of a document.
For example:

E:   !init OPT_LOOK="infomap"

Alternatively, {{CMD:sdf}}'s -k option can be used. For example:

E:   sdf -2ps -kinfomap mydoc

The -k option overrides the {{MAC:init}} macro setting.

Note: At this time (January 98), multiple looks are currently only
supported for paper documentation generated via FrameMaker.
Multiple look support will hopefully be added to other SDF output
drivers during 1998.

H2: Available looks

The available looks include:

* {{simple}} - the default look, useful for general documentation

* {{fancy}} - a look suitable for user documentation

* {{infomap}} - a look based on Information Mapping[[tm]]

* {{overhead}} - a look suitable for overhead transparencies.

H2: Creating new looks

It is relatively simple to create new looks
by inheriting details from an existing one.

Refer to the {{DOC:SDF Guru Guide}} for details.
