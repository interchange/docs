H1: Indexes

H2: Marking Entries

Index entries are specified by using the {{OATTR:index}} object attribute.
If a value is omitted, the text of the phrase is used.
For example, the following are equivalent:

V:  {{CMD[index="mycmd"]mycmd}} is useful for many things.
V:  {{CMD[index]mycmd}} is useful for many things.

Note: The {{OATTR:index}} attribute is only supported by {{mif}} format.
The value is mapped to index marker text using the notation
defined in chapter 23/24 (for [[FrameMaker]] 5.x/4.x respectively)
of {{Using FrameMaker}}.

Commonly used index formats are outlined below.

!block table
Format      Description
abc         add an entry called {{abc}}
abc:xyz     add an entry called {{xyz}} under {{abc}}
abc;def     add entries called {{abc}} and {{def}}
!endblock

NB: To include an actual semi-colon within an [[SDF]] attribute value,
you need to specify two semi-colons. For example:

V:To install {{PRD[index="myApp;;install:myApp"]myApp}}, ...
NE:

H2: Index Types

Different index types can be specified using the {{index_type}} attribute.
For example:

V:{{[index;index_type="author"]Joe Bloggs}} is famous for ...

The default index type is {{standard}}. Other types supported are:

* comment
* subject
* author.

H2: Setting FrameMaker Markers

A numeric value can also be specified (0..25) for the {{index_type}}
attribute. The value maps directly to a [[FrameMaker]] marker type.
The most commonly used marker numbers are 0 and 1 which
correspond to the {{$marker1}} and {{$marker2}}
building blocks of headers and footers.

The following example indirectly sets the first footer line in QSD books
while defining a level 2 heading:

V:  H2: Policy Standard {{N[index_type=0]QSDS0036}}

H2: Generating an Index

To generate an index, set the {{DOC_IX}} variable.
For example:

E:  sdf -b -DDOC_IX ...

Note: Index generation is only supported when {{CMD:sdf}} is
used in "book mode".

To generate other types of indexes, it is currently necessary
to use [[FrameMaker]].
See Chapter 23/24 of {{Using FrameMaker}} for details.
