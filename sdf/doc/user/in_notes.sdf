H1: Notes

H2: Short Notes

The paragraph tag for adding a single paragraph note is {{Note}}.
For example:

E:  Note: Life is too short to waste time being unhappy.

The result is:

Note: Life is too short to waste time being unhappy.

H2: Changing the Label

You can change the label for a note by using the {{PATTR:label}}
paragraph attribute. For example:

E:  Note[label='Important: '] Life is too short to drink bad wine.

The result is:

Note[label='Important: '] Life is too short to drink bad wine.

H2: Long Notes

If the note requires more than one paragraph, use the {{FILT:note}}
filter. For example:

E:  !block note
E:  Life is too short to:
E:
E:  * waste time being unhappy
E:  * worry about yesterday.
E:  !endblock

The result is:

!block note
Life is too short to:

* waste time being unhappy
* worry about yesterday.
!endblock

H2: The NB/NE Tags

Before the {{FILT:note}} filter existed, long notes were created
by using the NB (Note Begin) and NE (Note End) tags. For example:

E:  NB: Life is too short to:
E:
E:  * waste time being unhappy
E:  * worry about yesterday.
E:
E:  NE:

These paragraph styles are still supported, although the {{FILT:note}}
filter is now the recommended way of specifying long notes.
