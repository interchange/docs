<H2><A NAME="2.000beta9a - Enhancements">7.1. Enhancements</A></H2>
<P>A series of LOGO_BASE variables have been introduced so that the browser-time location of HTML images can be different to the compile-time location. For example, by defining:</P>
<PRE>
!define DOC_LOGO      &quot;mylogo&quot;
!define DOC_LOGO_BASE &quot;/images/&quot;
</PRE>
<P>the URL of the logo image will be &quot;/images/mylogo.gif&quot;.</P>
<P>New aliases have been introduced to make it easier to rebuild topics (+mt) and chapters (+mc) in the MIMS documentation. For example, to build the PostScript for the MIMS topic called 3201_msm200a.sdf, the command is:</P>
<PRE>
       sdf -2ps +mt 3201_msm200a
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="2.000beta9a - Fixes">7.2. Fixes</A></H2>
<P>Perl 5.004 introduced a warning about an odd number of elements in a hash list which previous versions of SDF occasionally triggered. The cause of the warning has now been fixed.</P>
<P>The <EM>label</EM> parameter on the <A HREF="../ref/fnote.html">note</A> filter now works.</P>
<P>Some minor documentation corrections have been made. In particular, the URL for the Ultimate editor is now correct.</P>
<P>Lines now appear above and below notes in HTML.</P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2.000beta9a - Incompatibilities">7.3. Incompatibilities</A></H2>
<P>The <A HREF="../ref/fbox.html">box</A> filter has been changed to do what people expect. The old behaviour is available by adding the <EM>lines</EM> parameter.</P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Future Incompatibilities!">7.4. Future Incompatibilities!</A></H2>
<P>The <B>next</B> version of SDF is probably going to be (almost) upwardly compatible with Perl5's POD format. As a result, the = character will be a multi-line macro invocation, rather than being a shorthand for E:. If you are currently using =, please replace it with E: in preparation for the next release.</P>
<P>Making SDF upwardly compatible with POD will undoubtedly introduce a few other incompatibility problems. However, I'll do what I can to minimise these. The goal is to make it possible to use SDF for Perl5 module documentation when POD is not sufficient.</P>
<P>If you have any feedback on the idea of making SDF upwardly compatible with POD, send some email to the SDF users mailing list (<A HREF="mailto:sdf-users@mincom.com">sdf-users@mincom.com</A>).</P>
<P>This release will also be the last one supporting Perl 4.036. Future releases will require Perl 5.</P>
