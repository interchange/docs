H1: Creating a New Format Driver

H2: Overview

The steps are:

^ Pick an existing driver to copy.
+ Copy it.
+ Make the necessary changes.
+ Update the {{FILE:sdf.ini}} file in the bin directory.

Simple, really! :-)

Good drivers to start from are {{FILE:totxt.pl}},
{{FILE:tohtml.pl}} and {{FILE:tomif.pl}}.
The drivers can be found in the {{perllib/sdf}} directory of
the SDF distribution.

H2: Required Skills

The following skills are required to write a format driver:

^ Good knowledge of the target format.
+ Perl programming.

It also helps if one has a look at {{SECT:SDFAPI}} before beginning.


H2: Driver Architecture Overview

An SDF driver interacts with the core SDF system as follows:

^ The {{FILE:sdf.ini}} file configures SDF so that the relevant driver
  is loaded and called, when necessary.

+ Each driver is implemented by a single subroutine which is
  responsible for initialising itself, processing the input,
  finalising things and returning the output.

+ The input should be processed by:
  ^^ calling the {{SdfNextPara}} routine within a while loop
  ++ for each paragraph, calling the {{SdfNextSection}} routine
     within a while loop.


H2: Some General Comments

If you are considering writing a driver, it might be a good idea
to let people on the SDF mailing lists know. If you're lucky,
someone else might have started a driver for the same output
format or be willing to assist you develop a new one.
Likewise, if you're having problems, send email to
{{EMAIL:sdf-bugs@mincom.com}}. Chances are, an SDF guru will
try to help.

As a rule, it is a good idea to use configuration files to
define the mappings from SDF entities to target entities.
In this way, people can override the default mappings
without changing your driver.

Depending on your skills, the amount of changes you need to make,
and your knowledge of SDF, the driver can take anything from 10
minutes to 10 weeks. Good luck. :-)
