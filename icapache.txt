} I've noticed some of the catalogs I've done are not indexed well with

} I'd like to start having stores be like
}
} http://www.yourdomain.com/index.html
} http://www.yourdomain.com/ord/basket.html
} instead of
} http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/yourstore/index.html
} http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/yourstore/ord/basket.html
}
} how do you accomplish this? I assume it can be done somehow.
 
In addition to using mod_minivend, previosuly suggested, you can do this
with Apache rewrite rules in the VirtualHost directive for yourdomain.com:
 
<VirtualHost a.b.c.d>
    ServerAdmin support@mainhost.com
    DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html/yourstore
    ServerName www.yourdomain.com
    ErrorLog logs/yourdomain-error_log
    CustomLog logs/yourdomain-access_log common
    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/home/httpd/cgi-bin/"
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule    ^$      /cgi-bin/yourstore/index.html    [PT,L]
    RewriteRule    ^/$     /cgi-bin/yourstore/index.html    [PT,L]
    RewriteRule    ^/index\.html$  /cgi-bin/yourstore/index.html    [PT,L]
    RewriteRule    ^/cgi-bin/yourstore/.*   -           [PT,L]
    RewriteRule    ^/(.*)      /cgi-bin/yourstore/$1        [PT,L]
</VirtualHost>
 
I just did this for a client and it works quite well (as long as you're
using a fairly recent version of Apache as your webserver).
