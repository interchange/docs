DOCUMENTATION STATUS

Currently only on the developer site:
Beginner's guide (conceptual stuff, maybe should be covered by Alison?)

On developer site, also distributed with IC:
icintro.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icinstall.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icconfig.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icdatabase.sdf (includes mv_metadata.pod; SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
ictemplates.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icbackoffice.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
iccattut.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icupgrade.sdf (new, from UPGRADE_FROM_MV3, compat/, deprecated.sdf, and various notes)
ictags.sdf (new, from Tagref.pm/mvtags.pod)
usertag.pod (./pod/usertag.pod, developer.akopia.com in database as HTML)

On developer site, in docs repository as POD:
mvfaq.pod

Only in docs repository:
mvdocs.pod -- needs to be checked to make sure everything made it into ic*.sdf
QuickStart -- outdated install and makecat stuff Alison is replacing

Once were auto-generated by Interchange from Tagref.pm:
mvtags.pod (also on developer site)
Docs are built with correct calling info from the actual IC code. Hard
to replace with static docs. But this file also contains introductory ITL info
and UserTag info as well, which is being moved to ictags.sdf.

Only in Interchange distribution:
README (brief intro, abbreviated file list, install, BSD etc. problem warnings)
README.cvs
README.debian
README.rpm
WHATSNEW (a log of changes to each version -- split out into -4.6, -4.7, etc.?)

Currently only in Word or FrameMaker format by Alison:
?

Needed:
* Documentation explaining what every default table and column is for, its spec, and the format of the data there (in icdatabase.sdf; started by Jason Kohles)

* FAQ for each catalog (foundation, construct, barry, artstore)

* FAQ for each database (DBM, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)

* FAQ for each payment processor (Cybercash, CCVS, Signio, Authorize.net, etc.)

* Live, functional ITL example web pages (like Mike suggested at
http://developer.akopia.com/cgi-bin/ic/examples/icintro_5a.html )

* Downloadable mail archives -- big zip or tarball or pointer to pipermail?

* Best of interchange-users -- developer site only?
