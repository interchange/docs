DOCUMENTATION STATUS

Currently only on the developer site:
Beginner's guide (conceptual stuff, maybe should be covered by Alison?)
Community-contributed usertags (was usertag.pod before 4.7.0; too messy)

Only in docs repository:

Further technical doc ideas:

* Single unified file with all references docs for easy searching.

* Documentation explaining what every Foundation Store table and column is for, its spec, and the format of the data there (in icdatabase.sdf; started by Jason Kohles)

* FAQ for each demo catalog (foundation, construct, barry, artstore)

* FAQ for each database (DBM, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)

* FAQ for each payment processor (CCVS, Cybercash, Signio, Authorize.net, etc.)

* Live, functional ITL example web pages (like Mike suggested at
http://developer.akopia.com/cgi-bin/ic/examples/icintro_5a.html )

* Downloadable mail archives -- big zip or tarball or pointer to pipermail?

* Best of interchange-users -- developer site only?
