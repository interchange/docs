DOCUMENTATION STATUS

Currently only on the developer site:
Beginner's guide (conceptual stuff, maybe should be covered by Alison?)
Community-contributed usertags (was usertag.pod before 4.7.0; too messy)

On developer site, also distributed with IC:
icbackoffice.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
iccattut.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icconfig.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icdatabase.sdf (includes mv_metadata.pod; SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icinstall.sdf (from QuickStart and new stuff; SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icintro.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
ictags.sdf (new, from Tagref.pm/mvtags.pod)
ictemplates.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icupgrade.sdf (new, from UPGRADE_FROM_MV3, compat/, deprecated.sdf, and various notes)

On developer site, in docs repository as POD:
mvfaq.pod

Only in docs repository:
mvdocs.pod -- needs to be checked to make sure everything made it into ic*.sdf

Only in Interchange distribution:
README (brief intro, abbreviated file list, install, BSD etc. problem warnings)
README.cvs
README.debian
README.rpm
WHATSNEW (a log of changes to each version pair, e.g. 4.5/4.6, 4.7/4.8)

Currently only in Word or FrameMaker format by Alison:
icadmin - Admin Guide
icstart - Getting Started Guide

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Further technical doc ideas:

* Single unified file with all references docs for easy searching.

* Documentation explaining what every Foundation Store table and column is for, its spec, and the format of the data there (in icdatabase.sdf; started by Jason Kohles)

* FAQ for each demo catalog (foundation, construct, barry, artstore)

* FAQ for each database (DBM, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)

* FAQ for each payment processor (CCVS, Cybercash, Signio, Authorize.net, etc.)

* Live, functional ITL example web pages (like Mike suggested at
http://developer.akopia.com/cgi-bin/ic/examples/icintro_5a.html )

* Downloadable mail archives -- big zip or tarball or pointer to pipermail?

* Best of interchange-users -- developer site only?

iccattut:

To add

Discuss profile.order verification options like 'zip=zip' and then explain why we don't actually use that one much unless it's for a U.S.-only store


Problems?

[on-match] gets used if search returned no results on an empty search string. Why?

Doubled-up CC verification errors:
mv_credit_card_valid: Card is expired. AND Card is expired.


Docs irregularities

Has the default search page changed? now pages/results.html, was special_pages/search.html.

[no-match] missing doesn't seem to go to special_pages/nomatch.html anymore.

[on-match] doesn't seem to be documented at all.


Could be fixed in Interchange

even missing.html won't work if pages/ dir doesn't exist! q.v. 127.0.0.1 csRgI56j:127.0.0.1 - [18/December/2000:22:32:58 -0500] tutorial /cgi-bin/tutorial/index.html Runtime error: Missing special page: ../special_pages/missing

No error message is given in [error] if required form variables weren't passed at all (vs. being simply empty)

No error message if profiles.order can't be found


Discuss using images (from old mvdocs):

A public Web directory for inline image graphic files is needed. Interchange does not serve the images, only the HTML tags calling them. A useful convention is to place all buttonbars, backgrounds, and icons in the /images directory, with the catalog items located in the /images/catalog directory. Regardless of the directory structure, an I<absolute path> must be used. Relative paths are unacceptable. Use the I<ImageDir> directive, which places that as the absolute path in front of all relative IMG and INPUT SRC, and BODY, TABLE, TR, TH, and TD BACKGROUND specifications.
