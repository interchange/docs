DOCUMENTATION STATUS

Currently only on the developer site:
Beginner's guide (conceptual stuff, maybe should be covered by Alison?)

On developer site, also distributed with IC:
icconfig.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icbackoffice.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
iccattut.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icdatabase.sdf (includes mv_metadata.pod; SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icinstall.sdf (from QuickStart and new stuff; SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icintro.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icupgrade.sdf (new, from UPGRADE_FROM_MV3, compat/, deprecated.sdf, and various notes)
ictags.sdf (new, from Tagref.pm/mvtags.pod)
ictemplates.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
usertag.pod (./pod/usertag.pod, developer.akopia.com in database as HTML)

On developer site, in docs repository as POD:
mvfaq.pod

Only in docs repository:
mvdocs.pod -- needs to be checked to make sure everything made it into ic*.sdf

Only in Interchange distribution:
README (brief intro, abbreviated file list, install, BSD etc. problem warnings)
README.cvs
README.debian
README.rpm
WHATSNEW (a log of changes to each version -- split out into -4.6, -4.7, etc.?)

Currently only in Word or FrameMaker format by Alison:
?

Needed:
* Documentation explaining what every default table and column is for, its spec, and the format of the data there (in icdatabase.sdf; started by Jason Kohles)

* FAQ for each catalog (foundation, construct, barry, artstore)

* FAQ for each database (DBM, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)

* FAQ for each payment processor (Cybercash, CCVS, Signio, Authorize.net, etc.)

* Live, functional ITL example web pages (like Mike suggested at
http://developer.akopia.com/cgi-bin/ic/examples/icintro_5a.html )

* Downloadable mail archives -- big zip or tarball or pointer to pipermail?

* Best of interchange-users -- developer site only?
