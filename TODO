Currently only on the developer site:
Beginner's guide (conceptual stuff, maybe should be covered by Alison?)

On developer site, also distributed with IC:
icintro.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icinstall.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icconfig.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icdatabase.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
ictemplates.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
icbackoffice.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
iccattut.sdf (SDF -> dev_html, PDF, POD)
usertag.pod (./pod/usertag.pod, developer.akopia.com in database as HTML)

On developer site, in docs repository as POD:
mvfaq.pod

Only in docs repository:
deprecated.sdf (should be part of larger version difference docs)
mvdocs.pod -- needs to be checked to make sure everything made it into ic*.sdf

Auto-generated by Interchange, also on developer site:
mvtags.pod
Docs are built with correct calling info from the actual IC code. Hard
to replace with static docs. But this file also contains introductory ITL info
and UserTag info as well, which should be moved to another doc.

Only in Interchange distribution:
./QuickStart (plain text, mostly ./configure and makecat stuff that's outdated)
./README (brief intro, abbreviated file list, install, BSD etc. problem warnings)
./README.cvs
./README.debian
./README.rpm
./UPGRADE_FROM_MV3
./WHATSNEW (a log of changes to each version -- split out into -4.6, -4.7, etc.?)
./pod/mv_metadata.pod (maybe would better be part of overall database schema docs)

Currently only in Word or FrameMaker format by Alison:
?

Needed:
* FAQ for each catalog (construct, foundation, barry, artstore)

* FAQ for each database (DBM, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)

* FAQ for each payment processor (Cybercash, CCVS, Signio, Authorize.net, etc.)

* Live, functional ITL example web pages (like Mike suggested at
http://developer.akopia.com/cgi-bin/ic/examples/icintro_5a.html )

* Downloadable mail archives -- big zip or tarball or pointer to pipermail?

* Best of interchange-users -- developer site only?
