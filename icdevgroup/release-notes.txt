RELEASING A NEW VERSION OF INTERCHANGE


Pre-release:

Check WHATSNEW
* review Git log and add anything missing
* add release date

Update copyright dates as appropriate if new year since last release
* README.md
* Makefile.PL
* configure
* scripts/interchange.PL  # header and /^sub version and /COPYRIGHT

Make sure version numbers are correct in all files:
* README.md
* Makefile.PL
* scripts/interchange.PL
* dist/strap/products/mv_metadata.asc (ui-version)
* SPECS/interchange.spec

Double-check MANIFEST:
* perl Makefile.PL nocopy
* make clean
* perl Makefile.PL nocopy
* rm -f MANIFEST
* LC_ALL=C make manifest
* git status   # should show no changes to MANIFEST; commit changes if needed

Review "git status" to make sure no junk is in the local checkout

Run regression test catalog

Build tarballs:
* make tardist
* tar xzpf interchange-5.7.2.tar.gz
* rm -f interchange-5.7.2.tar.gz
* tar cpf interchange-5.7.2.tar --owner=0 --group=0 --numeric-owner interchange-5.7.2
* gzip -9 interchange-5.7.2.tar

Test clean install:
* untar somewhere else
* build
* makecat of Strap demo
* place order
* use admin

Tag Git repository:
* git tag -a REL_5_7_2
* git push origin tag REL_5_7_2  # tags are not pushed automatically
(Re-tagging requires tag -f and shouldn't normally be done after a tag has been pushed.)

Note sha256sum output for .tar.gz

Create detached PGP signature of tarball: for i in interchange-*.tar.gz; do gpg -ba $i; done

Have people test the packages


Upload tarballs, README.md, WHATSNEW to:
interchangecommerce.org:~ftp/public_html/interchange...

Update interchange-latest.tar.gz symlink for stable releases
Update UPGRADE file to latest
Update WHATSNEW file to latest (no need to keep old ones in same branch, as their contents are still included in the latest file)


Update developer website:

* te catalog/products/news.txt   # announcement
* te catalog/products/variable.txt   # version variable(s)
* git commit; git push
* on server, git pull
* Save ANNOUNCEMENT-x.y.z.txt to interchangecommerce.org ftp area
* Run user icdevgroup's cron job generate-past-releases-list.pl, which updates the list that the "releases" page uses.
