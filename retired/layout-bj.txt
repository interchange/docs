Step 1: Define your databases
==============================

sample based on: http://www.bagshop.com/product/lisecharmel/lisechl23.php3
refer to catalogs/simple/products/products.asc in the simple demo

BagShop.com database
sku                 0023
mfr                 Lise Charmel
category            Lingerie
subcat              Panty ??
discount_group      Lingerie
description         Erable Series Thong
text                -optional- could contain more text for a separate
                    product flypage
price               53.00
weight              1
size                S M L XL
color               French Vanilla   (comma separated list)
image               product/lisecharmel/images/lc-erable1.jpg
image_height        453
image_width         310
tn_height           75
tn_width            50
etc...

Image could be simplified, and the path built up with mv tags like
  <a href="product/[item-field mfr]/images/[item-field image]
  height="[item-field image_height]" width=[item-field image_width]"
	alt="[item-description]">
and on a category page with thumbnails:
  <a href="product/[item-field mfr]/images/tn_[item-field image]
  height="[item-field tn_height]" width=[item-field tn_width]"
	alt="[item-description]">

Discount group -might- be of value when we learn what their discount
policy is.  All I know currently is "10% discount for Lingerie orders
over $200".  See discounts in the docs - this would allow us to set
several products to perhaps discount group "A".  Then we define a
discount rule such as 'buy 2 from this group, get a third free', etc.

BagShop.com category list database
----------------------------------
code              L23 
image             product/lisecharmel/images/lc-erable1.jpg
image_height      453
image_width       310
mfr               Lise Charmel
description       Erable Series L23
text              Lise Charmel Erable Series L23 - Multi-tones pf ecru cream and white guipure lace in a rich leaf motif.
min_price         42
max_price         86
list              0023 0123 0323 0523 3023 3123 3223 3323A 3323B 4923

The above is for a particular product line.  We would also use this 
format to enter the main category data, for example:

code              Lingerie
image             product/category/lingerie.jpg
image_height      453
image_width       310
mfr               Lingerie
description       optional text describing category
min_price         42
max_price         86
list              L23 etc. etc. list of product lines within lingerie

This may not be complete, but would be a good start.  Additional
fields can be added as needs arise.

Erik - you could go through this process with RCCW after you get a
feel for their products and site layout.

Category concept revisited...
The above method of listing categories is subject to:
  Pros:
     Total control over order of products on the category page
     Ability to add related products to any group of products
     Faster display of pages; no searches or sorts required
  Cons:
     Requires someone to maintain the lists of products

The other method of organizing products would be to add some 
additional field to our products.asc database.  For example, with
  category   Lingerie
  mfr        Lise Charmel
  line       Erable Series L23
we can create the referenced page by searching on 
'line=Erable Series L23' providing all the 'line's are unique.
If not, we might have to use a compound search on 2 or 3 of the
fields.
  Pros:
     A new product addition with the proper category/mfr/line
       will automatically appear upon a search
  Cons:
     Grouping (sorting) the search results may be difficult
       on reference page, we want panties to be grouped and
       the bras to appear in a logical order - not necessarily
       alphabetical or numerical order.  It is possible to add
       yet another field for 'sort order'.
     Compound searching/sorting take time on.  Okay on a lightly
       loaded server, but perhaps not on a busy one.  Static page
       build is one technique to lesson the burden.(see docs)

Cross-sell/up-sell
-------------------
We can add another field to our db - 'related'.  If we populate 
this with a list of sku's for companion products, then on our
product page we can have a section listing links to related items.
For instance, for our Erable Series L23 the panties could link
to the bras in the line, and vice versa.

The new Interchange Admin interface refers to this as 
'product matrixes'. 

Step 2: Identify Navigation Requirements
=========================================

Identify common navigation elements that can be broken into html
snippets and used on pages as mv includes.

Typically, we might have
header
left-side (optional)
footer
copyright  

Additional headers/footers might be defined for specific pages or
page groups, such as the basket/checkout pages.  These files are
typically defined near the top of catalog.cfg in the form:
ConfigDir pages
Variable    COPYRIGHT       <copyright
Variable    MASTHEAD        <masthead
Variable    SHOPNAV         <shopnav
Variable    RECEIPTNAV      <receiptnav
Variable    GENERALNAV      <generalnav
Variable    DIVIDER         <divider
ConfigDir config

In the case above, each html snippet exists in the pages directory (as
defined by ConfigDir).  They are truly snippets - no <html>,<body> etc
tags, as they will be included within existing thml pages.  Not a nav
element, strictly speaking, but the divider
definition above could contain simply <hr width="50%">, a properly
specified image tag, or might even contain nothing.  This allows us to
easily modify page dividers across the entire site from one location.

Masthead might contain simply a logo image definition, or could contain
the entire html definition at the top of the page - <html>,<body>,<head>
logo, etc. - but note that if you include basic html stuff, you may not
be able to view the page in a gui editor - since it requires mv parsing
to add the html codes. . .
