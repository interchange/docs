This is the Interchange documentation repository.

The official Interchange reference docs are currently maintained in
SDF, Simple Document Format. The canonical documents are listed in the
Makefile TARGETS= definition, roughly ic*.sdf. There may be sub-documents
included, usually with a .inc suffix.

The other files in this repository are notes or old/unfinished docs for
internal use.

You need to install SDF to build these documents. Do this as root:

cd sdf
./install

Make sure to update your local SDF installation whenever the SDF code
in this repository changes, as we will make changes to SDF code that
affect the quality of conversion to other formats. (Symbolic links to
your CVS-checkout directory will also work.)

To create documents in PDF formats, you will also need HTMLDOC.

from Red Hat E-Business Solutions.
