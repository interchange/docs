This is the new documentation root. Please do not distribute files from this
repository without approval from Akopia.

To set up your SDF environment do the following:

(1) install SDF using

    perl -MCPAN -e '"install I/IA/IANC/sdf-2.001.tar.gz"'

(2) hack PERLSITELIB/sdf/macros.pl by adding this line

1093a1094
>         push(@text, "!inherit \"look/$value\"") if($name eq 'OPT_LOOK');

(3) create PERLSITELIB/sdf/home/look/akopia and add the files from the akopia
    directory

(4) if you'll be making the dev_html target (if you're generating the
    Developer website), make this patch to PERLSITELIB/sdf/tohtml.pl:

37a38,41
> # Escape '[' characters -> '&#91;' for Akopia Interchange Tags
> # and __VARIABLE__ -> '&#95;_VARIABLE__'? (off by default)
> $_ITL_ESCAPE = 0;
>
518a523,524
>	$para =~ s/\[/&#91;/g if $_ITL_ESCAPE;
>	$para =~ s/_(_([^_]+_?)+__)/&#95;$1/g if $_ITL_ESCAPE;

    You'll need to set $_ITL_ESCAPE = 1 before building the developer site.
    NOTE! Remember to turn it off again when you're done!
