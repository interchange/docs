IC admin FAQ

-----

I deleted the super user from the admin screen! What do I do?

-----

In the help section, it states: "Apply Changes commits all changes
that the Interchange Administration Site doesn't commit automatically."
My question is, which kinds of changes are not committed automatically
and why. I have noticed that some sections let you know when you need
to reconfigure, but some don't.
